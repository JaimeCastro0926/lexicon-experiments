# lexicon-experiments

Open source experiments for the Lexicon Unity SDK

Place this repo in a folder inside your Assets folder. Suggested structure:

Assets  
|-- Lexicon  
|-- LexiconExperiments  
|-- NavMeshComponents  
|-- Watson  

Requires NavMeshComponents from Unity: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents

Note: You can grab the NavMeshComponents folder from that project, rather than starting with the full project.

To get started, drop the Experimental Workspace onto the Lexicon Runtime in any of the official samples. Be sure to sync the Experimental Workspace with Watson Speech to Text and Conversation.

To build a navmesh at runtime you might need to disable static batching on your project. Go to Player Settings > Other Settings and uncheck Static Batching.
